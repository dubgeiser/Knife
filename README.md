# Knife

Fork additions.

Knife started out as an extraction of code from my personal-just-for-learning
library.


## Install

Via composer (Knife is _not_ on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/)):

    "require": {
        "php": ">= 5.4.30",
        "dubgeiser/knife": "dev-master"
    },
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url":  "git@github.com:dubgeiser/Knife.git"
        }
    ]
